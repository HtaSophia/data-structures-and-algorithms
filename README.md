# Data Structures and Algorithms

**Data Structures and Algorithms** is a repository dedicated to exploring and implementing fundamental data structures and algorithms in JavaScript. This project is inspired by the book [Estruturas de dados e algoritmos com JavaScript](https://github.com/loiane/javascript-datastructures-algorithms).

## Problems

The `problems` folder contains my solutions to coding challenges related to data structures and algorithms. These challenges are sourced from popular platforms like LeetCode, and HackerRank.
